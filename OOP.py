# Building blocks of OOP
# Classes - a blueprint of an object
# Objects - an instance of a class
# Methods - methods represent behaviors
# Attributes - information to be stored in a class about an object

# Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from the parent class
# Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
# Abstraction: only exposing high-level public methods for accessing an object
# Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task
